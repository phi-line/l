## Lindy Authentication challenge

Here's my follow up on the engineering challenge I did for you guys on Monday, the 28th of October. I ran into some issues during the interview with `deno` and could not use the package `cookie-session` which I was intended to use for login.

I spent the day today to finish the challenge in `node` and this README outlines the approach that I took to complete it.

## Setup

```
npm i

npm run build

npm run start

npm run test
```

## Demo
